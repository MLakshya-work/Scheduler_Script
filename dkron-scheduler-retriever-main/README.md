# Dkron Scheduler Retrieval Project

This project allows you to retrieve scheduler information from *Dkron, a distributed cron job scheduler, using **Python*. The main goal is to provide an easy-to-use interface for fetching, managing, and monitoring cron jobs that are scheduled in a Dkron instance. It integrates seamlessly with your existing systems and allows for automation, querying, and monitoring of scheduled tasks.

## Features

•⁠  ⁠*Scheduler Retrieval*: The core feature of this project is the ability to fetch detailed information about the cron jobs scheduled in a Dkron instance. This includes critical data such as:
  - Job name and identifier
  - Last execution time
  - Next scheduled execution time
  - Job status (active, paused, etc.)
  - Job configuration and metadata

•⁠  ⁠*Python API Integration*: The project leverages Python to interface directly with Dkron's REST API. This provides a simple way to programmatically interact with Dkron, enabling you to automate tasks, monitor jobs, and query for job details in an efficient manner.

•⁠  ⁠*Real-Time Job Monitoring*: Keep track of the status of cron jobs in real-time. You can monitor which jobs are running, which have failed, and the timing of scheduled tasks.

•⁠  ⁠*Automated Reporting*: By querying the Dkron instance at regular intervals, you can generate automated reports on cron job performance, status, and history. This feature is useful for creating dashboards or integrating the data into other monitoring tools.

•⁠  ⁠*Customizable*: The project is designed to be flexible and can be extended to suit your needs. You can modify the retrieval process to only fetch specific job details, integrate it with a larger system, or store job details in a custom format.

•⁠  ⁠*Open-Source Collaboration*: As an open-source project, contributions are encouraged. You can contribute by adding new features, improving existing ones, or fixing any bugs you encounter. The aim is to build a community-driven tool for enhancing Dkron's usability and integration.

•⁠  ⁠*Extensibility*: The project is modular, allowing you to easily extend its functionality. You can add custom scripts to filter or modify the data retrieved from Dkron, integrate with other systems, or visualize the cron job data in different ways.
